********* Changes made **********************
logout.php has been placed in the php folder has been tested and logs you out successfully back to the main home page.

secure.php now has a fully function search engine in it that will search the vaportek website for any contacts that match a specific name e.g. scott.

There are 2 connections in both the login.php and secure.php.

There is one for xampp use and the other one for the fully operational website use.

If you are going to test the website using xampp remember to comment out the main website database connection and uncomment out the xampp database connection.
